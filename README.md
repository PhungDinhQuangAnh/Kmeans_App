# 🎨 KMeans App – Image Color Reduction & Clustering Visualization

A complete Python GUI application to:
- 📂 Upload and compress images by reducing colors using **KMeans clustering**
- 📊 Visualize and compare **KMeans algorithms** interactively with 2D point clustering
- 🖼️ Built with **Tkinter**, **Pygame**, and **Scikit-learn**

│   ├── sample_result.jpg      # Example processed image
│   └── visual.png             # Screenshot of visualization
```

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Easy-to-use GUI for image color reduction
- ✅ Choose number of clusters (k) interactively
- ✅ Auto-save processed images to assets folder
- ✅ Visual comparison between custom-built and built-in KMeans algorithms
- ✅ Clean codebase with modular structure

## 🧠 How It Works

### 🖼️ 1. KMeans Image Color Reduction (Tkinter GUI)
- Upload `.jpg`, `.png`, `.jpeg`, `.bmp`, `.gif`, `.tiff`, etc.
- Set number of clusters (k) to reduce the number of colors
- Displays both the **original** and **processed** image
- Saves the processed image with appropriate format in `assets/`

### 📈 2. KMeans Clustering Visualization (Pygame)
- Interactively add 2D points and random centroids
- Includes both a **custom-built KMeans algorithm** (implemented from scratch) and the **built-in Scikit-learn KMeans**
- Visualize how clusters are formed, centroids are updated, and errors decrease
- Enables learners to explore the inner workings of KMeans
- Great for learning and teaching **unsupervised learning** step-by-step
