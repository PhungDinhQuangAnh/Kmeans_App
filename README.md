<h1 align="center"> 🎨 KMeans App – Image Color Reduction & Clustering Visualization</h1>

A complete Python GUI application to:
- 📂 Upload and compress images by reducing colors using **KMeans clustering**
- 📊 Visualize **KMeans algorithm** interactively with 2D point clustering
- 🖼️ Built with **Tkinter**, **Pygame**, and **Scikit-learn**

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Easy-to-use GUI for image color reduction
- ✅ Choose number of clusters (k) interactively
- ✅ Auto-save processed images to assets folder
- ✅ Dynamic visualization of KMeans algorithm step-by-step
- ✅ Clean codebase with modular structure

---

## 🧠 How It Works

### 🖼️ 1. KMeans Image Color Reduction (Tkinter GUI)
- Upload `.jpg`, `.png`, `.jpeg`, `.bmp`, `.gif`, `.tiff`, etc.
- Set number of clusters (k) to reduce the number of colors
- Displays both the **original** and **processed** image
- Saves the processed image with appropriate format in `assets/`

### 📈 2. KMeans Clustering Visualization (Pygame)
- Interactively add 2D points and random centroids
- Visualize KMeans clustering behavior with point assignments
- Great for understanding the mechanics of unsupervised learning
